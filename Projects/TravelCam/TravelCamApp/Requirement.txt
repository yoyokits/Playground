                         TRAVELCAM APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

**CURRENT VERSION FOCUS: Android Devices (API 21+)**
This version prioritizes Android platform development and testing.
iOS and other platforms may be added in future versions.

1. CORE FUNCTIONALITY
   - Camera application for capturing photos and videos
   - Behaves like a default device camera with familiar UI/UX
   - UI preference: Google Material Design 3
   - Code style reference: CodeStyle.txt (must be followed if tooling does not load it automatically)

2. MEDIA CAPTURE
   - Photo capture with full resolution
   - Video recording with high quality
   - Front and back camera support
   - Sensor Value visualizer using ListView similar to ItemsControl in WPF
   - SensorItem class to show individual sensor values with Name property
   - Support for generated data like City, Date, Time, Country from GPS location
   - Default visible sensors: City, Country, Temperature
   - Ability to customize SensorItems and save settings as JSON file
   - Flash control
   - Zoom functionality

3. SENSOR VALUE APPEARANCE SETTINGS
   - Add `SensorValueSettings` view with a `SensorValueSettingsViewModel`
   - View acts as a sandwich control that opens when the user taps the Sensor Value view
   - Two lists:
     * Top: visible/selected sensor values
     * Bottom: invisible/unselected sensor values
   - Users can swipe items between lists to select/deselect
   - Users can reorder items in the visible list
   - Settings persist to a JSON file
   - On app start, apply settings by reading the JSON file
   - If a previous settings JSON exists, merge with the current default set
   - Future extensibility for appearance settings (e.g., font size)
   - Settings view: Material Design 3 style, max width 360dp, centered overlay

4. OVERLAY INFORMATION
   - Real-time overlay display on camera preview
   - Overlay data includes:
     * Temperature (current weather)
     * City name (from GPS location)
     * Height/Altitude (from GPS)
     * Map view (optional, can be toggled)
   - Default overlay: All info WITHOUT map
   - Overlay position: FIXED at bottom-right of camera preview

5. OUTPUT FILES
   - Storage location: App folder "CekliCam/" (in public Pictures directory)
   - File naming format: {Year}-{Month}-{Day}-{City}-{IncrementNumber}
     Example: 2024-12-25-CekliCam-001.jpg

   - Each capture produces ONE file in the main directory:
     - Photos: .jpg files
     - Videos: .mp4 files

6. GALLERY INTEGRATION
   - Clicking the preview image opens the most recent captured image
   - The gallery app opens showing the image, allowing user to browse the folder
   - On Android: Opens the specific image file using FileProvider
   - On iOS: Opens the Photos app to the app's media
   - On other platforms: Opens the default file viewer for the image

7. FILE TYPES
   - Photos: .jpg
   - Videos: .mp4

8. PERMISSIONS REQUIRED
   - Camera access
   - Microphone access (for video)
   - Video recording permission (Android)
   - Location/GPS access
   - Storage/file system access
   - Internet access (for weather data and maps)
